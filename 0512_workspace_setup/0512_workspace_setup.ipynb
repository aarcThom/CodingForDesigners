    "## Python the Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and initally released in 1991. It is consistently one of the most popular programming languages and is currently on the 3rd version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a syntax close to the English language which softens the learning curve for those without a programming background.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used in the AEC industry with scripting environments available for Rhino and Revit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an extremely popular language that is well documented. Students will have no trouble googling their way to solving issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the de facto language of data analysis, data science, machine learning but is also a general purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in the object oriented paradigm is well supported. These skills transfer over well to the other popular AEC language, C#.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its relative ease, it offers immense opportunities for further personal learning in more complex topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "```print(“Hello world!”)```\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s all you have to do to get Python to print a nice greeting to the screen. It might seem simple but Python abstracts away a lot of the heavy lifting to provide us with a nice legible interface. We consider Python a ‘high level language.’\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here’s how you would write “Hello world!” if you want to use a very low level language that will (almost) talk directly to your CPU: "
