    "### But First, Python For Loops - Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "*Think Python* chapter 3 introduced the concept of ***for loops***. We can use the keywords `for` and `in` to iterate over a collection of objects. We previously used a ***while loop*** to drive our number guessing game. Whereas a *while loop* can be thought of as \"repeat this thing until a condition is met\", a *for loop*, which will be much more commonly used in this course, can be thought of as as \"repeat a thing for each item we're iterating over\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a *while loop* would be \"while the car is dirty, wash the car,\" or stated another way, \"wash the car until it's clean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a *for loop* would be \"for each shirt in the basket, fold the shirt,\" or stated more naturally, \"fold each shirt in the laundry basket, until all shirts are folded.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### for i in range()\n",
    "In particular, we will look at iterating over a a list of numbers, generated by the `range()` function. `range()`, when passed one argument `stop` generates a list of integers from 0 up until the integer before `stop`. For instance, `range(5)` will return `[0,1,2,3,4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then write, `for i in range(5):` to iterate over each integer in that range. The indented lines of code following the colon `:` will be run for each integer we iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out but with the number 99."

In this case, we want to sing a song about 99 bottles, but as we saw from the last example, we actually need to generate a list of integers using `range(100)`.
