    "\n",
    "1. The program prompts the user to think of a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n",
    "2. The program defines a range, `num_range` of allowable guesses. If this is the first time the program runs, `num_range` = {1 < x < 100}.\n",
    "3. The program guesses the a number `guess` by choosing a number exactly in the middle of the range.\n",
    "    * for example, a range {1 < x < 100} yields a guess of 50\n",
    "4. The program asks the user if it guessed the correct number. If so, **the program ends** with a message, if not, it proceeds to step 5.\n",
    "5. The program asks if the user's number is lower or higher than its guess. If lower, `num_range` is updated to {`min(num_range)` < x < `guess`}. If higher, `num_range` is updated to {`guess` < x < `max(num_range)`}.\n",
